This repository hosts the implementation of the Merlin-Arthur Classifiers, a multi-agent interactive classifier framework aimed at enhancing interpretability in machine learning models. The work is detailed in our paper [*Interpretability Guarantees with Merlin-Arthur Classifiers*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00759), presented at AISTATS 2024, which introduces a novel approach to interpretability guarantees, inspired by the Merlin-Arthur protocol from Interactive Proof Systems.

The framework is demonstrated on two datasets: the MNIST and the UCI Census dataset, with a setup that includes a verifier (Arthur) and two provers (a cooperative Merlin and an adversarial Morgana). These roles are performed by various algorithms, including U-Nets, Stochastic Frank-Wolfe (SFW) algorithms, and hybrid approaches, which participate in a min-max game aimed at refining the classification process.

Interpretability is key to trust and ethical decision-making in AI, and our project aims to contribute in this domain. This repository offers the tools, instructions, and insights necessary for engaging with our approach, replicating our experiments, and potentially extending the methodology to new contexts. We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaborative efforts from the community to further this goal.

## Getting Started


### Setting up the Environment

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/merlin-arthur-classifiers.git
   cd merlin-arthur-classifiers
   ```

2. **Create and activate the Conda environment** using the provided `env.yml` file. This file contains all the necessary libraries and their versions:

    ```
    conda env create --file env.yml -n merlin-arthur 
    conda activate merlin-arthur
    ```

### Initializing `wandb`
After installing [`wandb`](https://wandb.ai/site), you need to login and initialize it in your project. Run the following command and follow the prompts to log in:
```bash
wandb login
```
This will require you to enter your API key, which you can find in your wandb dashboard under your profile settings.


## Basic Usage

This section outlines how to use the Merlin-Arthur Classifiers framework. The repository supports several training methods and datasets. Choose the approach and dataset relevant to your needs. Available training approaches are: `regular`, `sfw`, `mask_optimization`, and `unet`. Specify the desired approach through the command line argument when executing the training script `main.py`.

Debug mode can be activated using the command line argument `--debug` together with the other command line arguments. This executes the code running on two batches instead of the entire dataset. In the following examples, we always include the flag, i.e., activate the `debug mode`.  To save the checkpoint of the best model, you can add the `--save_model` flag. Be sure to change the save path to successfully save the checkpoint.

To explore additional configurations, please have a look on the `config_files\arg_parser.py` file or run the following command in the shell:
```bash
python main.py --help
```



### Regular Training 
Regular training can be conducted on two datasets: `MNIST` and `UCI Census`. You can customize the command line arguments to fit your specific training needs. Below is a template that outlines various customization options for your training setup, adjusted to the context of regular training on the MNIST and UCI Census datasets.

**Customization Options:**

- **Training Approach:** Specify with `--approach`, where `"regular"` is used for standard training.
- **Dataset Selection:** Choose between `MNIST` and `UCI-Census` with the `--dataset` flag.
- **Epochs:** Configure the number of training epochs with `--epochs`.
- **Batch Size:** Adjust the training batch size with `--batch_size`.
- **Learning Rate:** Set the learning rate with `--lr`.
-  **Model Architecture:** Specify the model with `--model_arthur`, e.g., `"SimpleCNN"` for MNIST or `"UCICensusClassifier"` for UCI Census.
- **Normalization:** Enable feature normalization with `--add_normalization`.

#### MNIST Dataset

To perform regular training on the `MNIST` dataset:

```bash
python main.py --debug \
    --seed 42 \
    --approach "regular" \
    --use_amp \
    --dataset "MNIST" \
    --epochs 10 \
    --batch_size 512 \
    --binary_classification \
    --lr 0.001 \
    --model_arthur "SimpleCNN" \
    --add_normalization \
    --wandb
```
</td>

#### UCI Census Dataset

For the UCI Census dataset, we need to change the `--dataset` and `--model_arthur` flags:
```bash
python main.py --debug \
    --seed 42 \
    --approach "regular" \
    --use_amp \
    --dataset "UCI-Census" \
    --epochs 10 \
    --batch_size 512 \
    --binary_classification \
    --lr 0.001 \
    --model_arthur "UCICensusClassifier" \
    --add_normalization \
    --wandb
```

### Merlin-Arthur Training
After saving a pre-trained Arthur classifier locally, the next step is to go through the Merlin-Arthur training process. In this phase, Merlin and Morgana are introduced to a strategic min-max game to refine and improve the interpretability of the classification process.

Merlin-Arthur Training features a collaborative interaction between Merlin and Arthur, alongside a min-max game dynamic with Morgana challenging Arthur. In this constellation, Morgana strives to maximize Arthur's loss, while Arthur strives to minimize it. This three-player interaction enhances the interpretability of the classificaiton process through its adversarial approach. Additionally, the training framework is designed for versatility, allowing customization to specific datasets (e.g., `MNIST`, `UCI Census`) and tailored training methodologies (e.g., `unet`, `sfw`, `mask_optimization`). 

To initiate Merlin-Arthur training, specify the approach, dataset, and other relevant parameters when executing the `main.py` script. Below are examples for different scenarios.

**Customization Options**
- **Debug Mode:** Activated by adding `--debug`, running the script on a smaller subset for quicker iterations.
- **Model Configuration:** Adjust `--mask_size`, `--lr`, `--gamma`, `lr_merlin` , `lr_morgana` and other parameters to fine-tune the training process.
- **Checkpoint Loading**: Adjust `--pretrained_path` to load the checkpoint of the pretrained Arthur.

### Advanced Features

The Merlin-Arthur Classifiers framework provides a range of advanced configuration options to fine-tune the training process according to specific research needs or objectives. These options include a variety of regularization techniques and alternative loss functions, allowing for extensive customization of the model's behavior and optimization criteria.

#### Custom Loss Functions and Optimization

- **Optimize Probabilities**: Enable optimization directly on the probabilities by setting `--optimize_probabilities`.
- **Alternative Loss Function**: Utilize the loss function proposed by Dabkowski et al. (2017) with `--other_loss`.

#### Regularization Techniques

To further refine the model and control overfitting, the following regularization penalties can be applied:

- **L1 Penalty**: Introduce sparsity in the model parameters with `--l1_penalty` and specify the coefficient with `--l1_penalty_coefficient`.
- **L2 Penalty**: Add regularization to reduce model complexity using `--l2_penalty`, adjusting its impact via `--l2_penalty_coefficient`.
- **Total Variation (TV) Penalty**: Enhance the model's generalization by incorporating a TV penalty for spatial smoothness with `--tv_penalty`, specifying the coefficient with `--tv_penalty_coefficient` and adjusting the penalty power for SFW with `--tv_penalty_power`.

These advanced features are designed to empower users to experiment with and optimize the Merlin-Arthur Classifiers framework for their unique use cases, enhancing both performance and interpretability.

For a comprehensive list of all available options and further details on how to configure these features, please refer to the `config_files\arg_parser.py` file within the repository.

## Datasets
The MNIST dataset will be downloaded and saved to `.data/MNIST` or `.data/CustomMNIST`. The raw UCI-Dataset will be first downloaded and saved to `.data/adult.data` for training and `.data/adult.test` for testing, correspondingly. The dataset will then be preprocessed and saved to `.data/sex_target_encoded_data_train.pkl` and `.data/sex_target_encoded_data_test.pkl` if `sex` is the target feature. If you want to skip the preprocessing steps, you can set `read_pre_processed=False` in the data preparation located in `merlin_arthur_framework.py` 


## Models
In the framework, we offer a diverse array of models, each tailored to accommodate different requirements and research interests. These models range from simple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to more complex architectures like ResNet and U-Net variants. Below is a brief overview of the models available:

- `ResNet18`: A modification of the classic ResNet18 model for customizable input channels and class numbers, supporting pre-trained weights for transfer learning.

- `SimpleCNN`: A straightforward CNN model for basic image classification tasks, with a simple stack of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

- `DeeperCNN`: An extended CNN architecture for image processing tasks, featuring multiple convolutional and fully connected layers.

- `Net`: A basic neural network with convolutional and pooling layers, tailored for simple image classification problems.

- `SimpleNet`: An adaptable architecture combining U-Net-like downscaling and upscaling with a flexible output mechanism, suitable for tasks requiring detailed spatial understanding.

- `UCICensusClassifier`: A neural network specifically designed for classifying categorical data, illustrating the framework's capability to handle non-image data.

- `SaliencyModel`: A reproduction of the model from [Dabkowski et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07857), designed to generate saliency maps for highlighting decision-critical areas in images, emphasizing interpretability.

These models exemplify the framework's versatility, catering to a wide range of machine learning and computer vision tasks. Users can easily adapt these models for their specific projects or extend them to explore new research directions.

## Entropy
The lower bound and precision of the pretrained Merlin-Arthur-Framework can be calculated using the `main_entropy.py` script. This loads the saved models of Arthur and Merlin and calculates the corresponding metrics. Note that the flags need to be set accordingly to setup each agent.
